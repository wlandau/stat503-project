This is the project folder for my STAT 503 final project (spring 2015). The files ``report/report.Rmd``, ``report/report.bib``, and ``report/report.pdf`` are the source, bibliography, and output for the report, respectively. To compile the report, the R code files in the ``R`` folder and the data dictionaries in the ``dictionaries`` must be present. RDS files in the ``cache`` folder will automatically be created during the report's compilation, and leaving those files alone will speed up subsequent compilations. Without the ``cache`` files, your computer may need to be connected to the internet so that the R code can automatically download the large 2012 PISA student dataset, which takes a long time.
